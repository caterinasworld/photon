Splitters are used to separate the contents of developer tools into several resizable panes.

## Usage

<div class="grid-2" markdown="1">

To view split panes in developer tools, use splitters to separate the views.
</div>

## Future Work

Splitters will be 2px wide in vertical mode and have a hover effect. This is currently available in Nightly.
