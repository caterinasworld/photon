Overlay is a temporary layer covers on the content that shouldn’t be focused on.

## Usage

Use overlay when you have an important part of UI that needs users’ attention without getting distracted by the rest of the content. A pop-up window and an onboarding tour are the typical examples of using overlay.

## Style

<div class="grid-2" markdown="1">
![overlay example](../images/overlay/overlay-style.svg)

Overlay color: Gray 90 a60\\
`rgba(12, 12, 13, 0.6)`
</div>
