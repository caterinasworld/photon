Photon is the Firefox design language to build modern, intuitive, delightful experiences, for products across all platforms – from mobile to desktop, from TV to the next big thing.

The Photon Design System houses guidelines, reusable UI components, templates, and other resources to help you create products for Firefox users. It is flexible and always evolving to serve the best Firefox experience for every situation.

Using this system will help make your work more efficient, and our products more consistent, while still looking, feeling, and sounding uniquely Firefox.

You can help us improve the system and ensure it remains current and relevant.
